* Shop is my attempt at a self-contained shop type thing
The idea is that (like mochstrap) you use this project to generate a simple, skinnable interwebz shop
It is supposed to allow you to add products to your inventory, then sell those products on your pages.
There will be a basket and a checkout that uses Paypal Express Checkout.
It will be as modular and resuable as possible. Hopefully you just add your front end pages. We shall see.
The idea is to be able to create skinnable, customisable web shops for a few hours work.
